SCCP-Manager v. 1.0 for FreePBX


Introduction.

	This module has been developed to help IT Staff with their Asterisk-Cisco infrastructure deployment, 
providing easily provisioning and managing Cisco IP phones and extensions in a similar way as it does with Cisco CallManager.

Advantages.

As we are using SCCP Channel, no SIP firwmare upgrade is needed for each phone, saving a lot of time 
and money (you can not come back from SIP to SCCP under CallManager without paying new licenses).  

If you are thinking to migrate from CallManager to Asterisk (or did it), SCCP-Manager allows you 
to administer SCCP extensions and a wide range of Cisco phone types (including IP Communicator).
You can control phone buttons (depending on the phone model) assigning multiple lines, speeddials and BLFâ€™s.
And you can also reset phones from the module GUI.
